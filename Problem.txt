we want to print invoice. 
This invoice could be for food and its' subcategories, for electronic devices, for furniture, for ....
Now this needs to be dynamic, or in other words, this invoice should be a single class that could accept any form of input it takes

Now Our problem also lies with what we want to print.
Say someone ordered Shoes for his office. 
They said they wanted 1000 pair of shoes:

now we need to ask: 
1- how many of them are for men, and how many are for woment
2- What type of shoes are they (working shoes, field shoes...etc.)
3- What sizes of shoes do you want?
4- is the shoe size in US format, EU format or what?

How can we handle this problem?
do we think of it as a filtering problem:
